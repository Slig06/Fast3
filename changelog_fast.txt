3.2.1s
------
Too many time and changes to list all now...
- fixed manialinks had sometimes strange reaction on some servers,
        should be fixed
- fixed tm_substr() now make a full/real control that a utf8 string is
        comatible with the tm dedicated. All plugins should use it
        on player nicknames or map names (btw for players you can use
        NickDraw, NickDraw2 or NickDraw3 in $_players most time).
        (please don't use it for each draw : store the result and use it !)
- fixed now if the call of methods to  the dedicated make a utf8 related
        error, Fast try to fix it and resend. Btw it is a rescue
        feature ! plugins have to use tm_substr() to avoid such case
        to happen. In case of utf8 error, if $_debug >= 2 then the
        call is serialized and saved to a file, which can be used
        to help debug.
- added method to dedicated can now be sent asynchronously (ie not
        loosing time waiting for the response). It can be used
        explicitally using addCallAsync() instead of addCall().
        Manialinks and chat now use it automatically, which should
        improve script reactivity when there are many players, and
        also make manialinks faster.
- added max player control when the server is ladder >60K (it does not
        set the max player number, but verify that the max is
        respected and put the last new player as spec if needed).
        Setting as player above max number (with Fast, not using external
        controller) is now also forbidden.
- added server and spec passwords control, forbidding them for ladder servers
- added some chat commands added or fixed, mainly :
- added a false start feature, which restart round/race in case of early
        'del' or netlost at beginning. It is disabled by default, and
        have associated /falsestart (or /fs) commands.
- added /team score back #, /rounds score back # and /cup score back #
        which permit to set back to score of previous round.
- added now restart/next/prev don't reset Cup scores : to reset scores
        use /cup reset , /adm next reset , /adm prev reset , /adm restart reset
